Lindsay C. Gibson

      

Setting your deadlines shouldn't be felt as putting you inside a box. A proper deadline should be making space for your creativity.

Injuries to self-esteem come from feeling that your [[uniqueness]] was rejected

Sometimes adult children and their parents, whether emotionally immature or not, have conflicts over competing interests. Since parents are accustomed to being the authority figures, it often falls to the adult child to lead the way to a more equal and respectful adult relationship. For instance, when parents try to take over or give advice, you might say, **"Well, that's a good idea, Mom, but it's important for me to think this through for myself?"**

Remember, you have the right to be heard, not just seen, and tyrannical talkers can be just the ticket for your recovery. Speak up.

What should you do if you get the cold shoulder? First, realize that the person is using behavior instead of words to express their feelings. They probably learned it in their family and are just passing it along to you. Assume, therefore, that they don't know how to talk about feelings or disagreements. But you don't have to make their shunning the centerpiece of your attention by obsessively worrying or feeling “bad”. Instead, treat them as if they are unwell, saying something like: "I see that I’ve upset you. I wish you could talk to me about it, but maybe you can't right now. Let's talk later on when you're feeling better." Then drop it.

**But if you stop the blaming and instead take responsibility for your part in any problem - miniscule though it may be - you get closer to a solution because you are dealing with the one thing you do have control over.**

**A problem is not asking for your approval or disapproval. It is just showing you a piece of reality you did not see coming. If you can meet the problem with acceptance and curiosity, you may end up with a solution that sharpens your skills and makes you proud of what you accomplished.**
