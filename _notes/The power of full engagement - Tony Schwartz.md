### The power of full engagement - Tony Schwartz

Performance, health and happiness are grounded in the skillful management of energy.

Most professional athletes also enjoy an off-season of four to five months a year.

Full engagement requires drawing on four separate but related [[sources of energy]]: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual.

Build positive rituals: purpose-truth-action
Purpose: how do I spend energy so that it aligned with my values? 
Truth: how do I spend energy now?
Action: how to close the gap between the two?

Energy diminishes with overuse and underuse.


##### [[Oscillatory beings in an oscilotary world]]
Nature follows some rythms in weather, seasons, day/night life. We follow those rythms too working during the day and needing a sleep at night, even our heartbeat follows those rythms hour by hour. The same way we should follow those rythms to make an effort and then compensate the corresponding amount of energy. Each of 4 energy types should be rythmically wasted and compensated in the same way (if something is not being used, it gets atrophied).



Everyone needs activities that serve as a break or a source of disengagement (like juggling).

We got used to be trying more like machines ([[machine-centered]]), but we are humans that have needs and special features

Oscilatory nature of all human beings is to keep swining between full engagement and disengagement.


[[Expanding capacity]] requires putting up with a short-term discomfort in order to get a long-term reward.
Four types of capacity (spiritual, emotional and mental) can follow the same rule of pushing over your limits as we do with our physical capacity. We expose ourselves to some stress and follow it by the corresponding amount of recovery. And only after the recovery period you can go back to your normal level of capacity and usually people can go much further after this kind of stress and recovery. If you go back to early you might injure yourself. If you go back too late, you'll loose some of your progress.


4pm is the time of highest level of fatigue. 






What gives me real relaxation?
- singing
- stretching
- walking in a good weather
- painting
- writing down my thoughts




The best professional players have  as much rest as possible between plays, their heart rate drops significantly.

Watching television is the mental and emotional equivalent of eating junk food. It may provide a temporary form of recovery, but it is rarely nutritious and it is easy to consume too much.

Psychologist [[Martin Seligman]] spent several years studying the relationship between positive thinking and sales success.”
Turned out that positive thinkers could sell more than others.

Finally, during her thirty-minute commute to work, Sara built a [[mental preparation ritual]]—thinking through the day ahead, and visualizing how she wanted to handle the specific challenges that she faced.

Continuing to challenge the brain serves as a protection against age-related mental decline.

We define “[[spiritual]]” not in the religious sense, but rather in more simple and elemental terms: the connection to a [[Deeply held set of values]] and to a purpose beyond our self-interest”.

Spiritual capacity is the source of the most unpredictably immense amount of energy. It is very important to regularly reassess one’s values. Such spiritual activities can be both a source of energy expenditure and renewal at the same time.

[[Nietzsche]]’s famous words, “He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.

We have unrealized capacities that sometimes only emerge in crisis

One client example still stays in my mind. His spiritual capacity was weak, his job didn’t amaze him anymore. They suggested him to try something new. He found an orphanage in his neighborhood. He suggested coaching kids there.

Spiritual energy is derived from a connection to deeply held values and a purpose beyond our self-interest.

It never seemed to occur to the folks in charge that if trees are to survive in a high-wind area, they must have a deeper root structure. It did occur to us that we were observing in nature a phenomenon that characterizes many of our own lives. Because we so often lack deep roots—firm beliefs and compelling values—we are easily buffeted by the prevailing winds. If we lack a strong sense of purpose we cannot hold our ground when we are challenged by life’s inevitable storms. Instead, like Roger, we react defensively, blaming the storm or simply disengaging and ceasing to invest our energy. “You can work long hours but still be slothful,” writes Joanne Ciulla, author of The Working Life.

Measuring purpose 1-10
1. How excited are you to get to work in the morning? 3 not excited
2. How much do you enjoy what you do for its own sake rather that for what it gets you? 4-5 Usually it’s hard to concentrate on a process.
3. How accountable do you hold yourself to a deeply held set of values? 3 Not accountable


«Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is **he** sho is asked» [[Viktor Frankl]]


When we are preoccupied with filling our own holes to stay afloat we have little evergy left to define a deeper and more enduring purpose ([[being on a leaking boat]] metaphor).

Purpose becomes a more powerful source of energy when you enjoy the process more than the result itself, when you have a truly free choice of choosing the activity.

Sometimes it’s more important to stay connected with people than to be right

[[Extrinsic motivation]] reflects the desire to get more of something that we don’t think we posses enough of. Intrinsic motivation reflects the desire to engage in an activity for the value the the activity itself provides.

Negative motivation short-lived.

To set positive goals we should follow two steps:
1. Chart your course. In the beginning of the day revisit your goals/values?/priorities. Imagine how you want to spend the day, how you want to succed and reach your goals.
2. Keep track of your progress. In the end of the day we want to know if we reached our goals for the day, how much accountable we were. It can as easy as writing down yes or no to the same question every evening.


#### If you are falling short in achieving a goal
If you are falling short in implementing a particular ritual or achieving the outcome that you are seeking, several explanations are possible. It may be that the ritual isn't grounded in a value or a vision that is truly compelling to you. It may be the goal that you set is simply too ambitious and needs to be implemented more slowly and 



From our work with athletes we learned that visualizing a performance challenge in advance is a very effective way to allay anxiety and to perform without awkwardness or self-consciousness.

The issue is not so much whether your life is providing you with a sense of meaning as it is whether you are actively using life as a vehicle through which to express your deepest values.
