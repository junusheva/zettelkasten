It’s very important how safe one feels. In an experiment rats had an implanted thing into the part of the brain that tells us if we should avoid or approach something (get curious). This implant can stimulate either approach or avoid stimulus. It turns out that if a rat feels really safe, it’s hard to stimulate avoiding behavior. Otherwise, if a rat feels that the environment is really dangerous, the approach behavior is hardly stimulated.
