>The laws of economics and many studies of diversity tell us that if we tapped the entire pool of human resources and talent, our collective performance would improve.

>Conditions for all women will improve when there are more women in leadership roles giving strong and powerful voice to their needs and concerns.

>In addition to the external barriers erected by society, women are hindered by barriers that exist within ourselves. We hold ourselves back in ways both big and small, **by lacking self-confidence, by not raising our hands, and by pulling back when we should be leaning in**. We internalize the negative messages we get throughout our lives--the messages that say it's wrong to be outspoken, aggressive, more powerful than men. We lower our own expectations of what we can achieve. We continue to do the majority of the housework and child care. We compormise our career goals to make room for partners and children who may not event exist yet.


### 1. The leadership Ambition Gap
My grandmother and mother. My grandmother, I don't know anything about my grandmother's career. I know that she was an economist, completed a university probably. When she got pregnant she probably stopped working. However, my told me that we that my grandfather had been helping her with the child care. However their family travelled a lot due to my grandfather's job **TODO: Ask mom about my mother's mom's career.**

As for my grandmother on father's side. She was a tough woman who had to take care of the whole household since her husband was suffering from ill-health and he died when my father was in 8th grade.

My mother finished the university and was working as an accountant in some bank (?). When she gave birth to me she continued working for some time while my grandmother took care of me. Later (?) she stopped working and devoted herself to her family.

>Career progression often depends upon taking risks and advocating for oneself - traits that girls are disouraged from exhibiting.

>Men are continually applauded for being ambitious and powerful and successful, but women who display these same traits often pay a social penalty. Female accomplishments come at cost.

>And for all the progress, there is still societal pressure for women to keep an eye on marriage from a young age. When I went to college, as much as my parents emphasized academic achievement, they emphasized marriage even more. They told me that the most eligible women marry young to get a "good man" before they are all taken.

Здесь она говорит, что отказалась от международных исследовательских программ, потому что вероятность найти построить долгосрочные отношение (=найти будущего мужа) сильно снижалась за рубежом. В итоге она поступила в Вашингтон, нашла мужа, вышла замуж, развелась через год.

Эта история напомнила мне, как я боялась поступать за рубеж в университет. Конечно, кроме этого мне не хотелось взваливать такую ношу на родителей, ну и я не верила, что смогу поступить бесплатно. Но не суть. Я отлично помню, как я сильно боялась, что после универа придется наверстывать и "искать" мужа в КР. Не спрашивайте, почему я так боялась выйти замуж за европейца, или почему я думала, что я там не смогу найти кыргыза. Мне тогда казалось, что выйти замуж - это цель топ один, и не в КР вероятность успеха снижается. 

Я уже давно так не думаю, но как же грустно, что столько энергии уходило на эти мысли! Эта энергия могла бы пойти на поступление в другой универ, или на какие-то еще курсы, ну или просто на беззаботную и счастливую жизнь. 





### 2. Sit at the Table
>A moment when I realized that in addition to facing institutional obstacles, women face a battle from within.

Она рассказала про встречу, которую она организовывала для министра финансов США. На встречу были приглашены главы разных компаний, в основном мужчины. В начале все обменялись приветствиями и пошли к столу. За ними пошли секретарши, все женщины. И вместо того, чтобы сесть за общий стол, они пошли к стульям у края комнаты. Шерил пригласила их к столу, но они отказались. Ей было грустно, что имея полное право быть частью этого события, частью разговора, они побоялись.

Я очень понимаю этих женщин. 

PRETEND TO BE CONFIDENT TO START BELIEVING IN IT ([[fake it till you feel it]])

>...There is no perfect fit when you're looking for the next big thing to do. You have to take opportunities and make an opportunity fit for you, rather that the other way around. The ability to learn is the most important quality a leader can have. 

(Это заставило меня вспомнить, как мы с Эмиром подстраивали квартиру под себя и от этого почувствовали ее своей).

>Taking initiative pays off. It is hard to visualize someone as a leader if she is always waiting to be told what to do.

>If we want a world with greater equality, we need to acknowledge that women are less likely to keep their hands up. We need institutions and individuals to notice and correct for this behavior by encouraging, promoting, and championing more women. And women have to learn to keep their hands up, because when they lower them, even managers with the best intentions might not notice.


### 3. Success and likability
>For men, professional success comes with positive reinforcement at every step of the way. For women, event if recognized for their achievments, they were regarted unfavourably.

Journalist [[Shankar Vedantam]] listed descriptions of some female world leaders:
- [[Margaret Thatcher]] - Atilla the Hen
- [[Golda Meir]] - the only man in the cabinet
- [[Indira Gandhi]] - the old whitch (Richard Nixon named her this way)
- [[Angela Merkel]] - the iron frau

> In order to protect ourselves from being disliked we question our abilities, downplay our achievements, espessially in presence of others. We put ourselves down before others can.

Professor [[Debora Gruenfeld]]:  We believe not only that women are nurturing. We also believe that women should be nurturing above all else.

My favourite story: [[How Sheryl Sandberg was negotiating with Mark Zuckerberg for her compensation]]. She was really okay with the offer, she thought that it was fair. Her husband and some other relative were trying to persuade her to negotiate for more since the current offer is less than any man would accept. So the next meeting she told Mark that she wouldn't accept the offer. She said that the company is accepting her as a good negotiator and that the current meeting is the last time when two of them are on the opposite sides of the table. Then she negotiated hard for a better compensation, nervously slept a night and finally got a much better offer.

In this book a professor is suggesting women to negotiate using a technique: "Think personally, act communally".  So instead of accepting the offer right away we should say: I know that women in my position usually get paid less then regularly do men, so I'll negotiate rather than accept the current offer.

"[[Relentlessly peasant]]" style of negotiation, when women have to combine niceness with insistence. 

When the auther got her job at Facebook she got haters who left awful comments about her saying that she will ruin Facebook. She cried because of it

Huffington post founder [[Arianna Huffington]] early in her career realized that speaking her mind will eventually offend someone. She understands that asking women to ignore attacks of haters is unrealistic, so she suggests to react as you would normally react, with anger or sadness, by crying or shouting, and after your reacttion **move on**. She compares this tactic to the one her children use. They never hesitate to cry on any issue that upset them, but they right away get involved by some other thing.

### 4. It's a jungle gym, not a ladder

>Careers are a jungle gym, not a ladder.

"Career jungle" serves a better metaphor since it reflects the idea that you can change your path in any moment, take a break, come back, change your path again. A jungle gym also allows all people to enjoy the view, while in a ladder you might get stuck starring in someone's back.

> Empoyees who focus on results and impact are the best

### 5. Are you my mentor?

Asking to be one's mentor is awkward and useless. Ways to find a mentor:
- Grow on your own, take more responsibility and ownership and mentor will find you
- Decide which of your questions can't be answered on your own and ask only thoughtful precise questions to people you think might have the answers. Don't spend much of their time, there is no need for a whole dinner or an hour meeting every week. Try to do all possible homework before asking your questions and when answered ***always follow-up on the results of your discussion***.
- Official metorship programs. Usually those are the best when combined with other kinds of training.

Mentorship is a two-way relationship and mentors themselves get a lot from it: from sence of meaning to pride and connecting the team (in case he/she is your manager). 

Since senior leaders usually choose those mentees who remind them of themselves in past, senior men usually choose men as mentees. So men should just take this fact into account and help women to solve this problem.

Another isssue of senior man - junior women model is the notion of sexual component. Everyone in this interaction has to make sure that the relationship is kept professional and the space is safe.

## 6. Seek and speak your truth
