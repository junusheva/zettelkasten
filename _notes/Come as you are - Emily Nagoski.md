[[Homologues]] are traits that have the same biological origins, though they may have different functions.

Even though the [[hymen]] performs no physical or biological function, many cultures have created myths around the hymen so profound that there are actually surgeries available to “reconstruct” the hymen, as if it were a medical necessity.


##### We’re all made of the same parts, just organized in different ways.
Every body’s genitals are the same until six weeks into gestation, when the universal genital hardware begins to organize itself into either the female configuration or the male configuration.

Vulvas also have a set of glands at the mouth of the urethra, the orifice we pee out of, called Skene’s glands. These are the homologue of the male prostate. The prostate does two things: It swells around the urethra **so that it’s difficult or impossible to urinate during sexual arousal**, and it produces about half of the seminal fluid in which sperm travels.

There were few sexual response models, but the latest one is the dual-control model. It implies that we have sexual accelerators and sexual breaks. Most of the people have normal accelerators and break, but small amount of people have more sensitive accelerators or breaks and otherwise. These SA and SB are not innate, we learn how we should respond to things while we grow up. There was an experiment with rats. One of the rats had their sexual debut ("lost virginity") with a rat that smelled with lemons. Another one had sex with normal one. The first one got a fetish on rats smelling with lemons, another didn't.

One area of the brain (“one ring” 💍) controls all our pleasures. This system involves learning, liking and wanting. Learning doesn’t evaluate, it is just connecting the dots: when father is not in the mood, you better leaving him alone. Once you understand that something new you learnt is nice => liking is here. If something is nice enough => you want it
