### Maybe you should talk to someone? - Lori Gottlieb

Sitting-with-you-in-your-pain is one of the rare experiences that people get in the protected space of a therapy room, but it's very hard to give or get outside of it — even for Jen, who is a therapist.




“Our professors gave us two instructions before we set foot in the lab. One: Pretend that the bodies belonged to our grandmothers and show respect accordingly. (“Do normal people slice up their grandmothers?” one freaked-out student replied.) Two: Pay attention to any emotions that came up during what we were told would be an intense process”
…
“We opened each lab session by unzipping the bag containing our cadaver and pausing as a class for a minute of silence to honor the people who were letting us take their bodies apart.”




The final day of the course, there was a ceremony in which we paid our respects to the people who had let us learn from their bodies. We all read personal thank-you notes to them, played music, and offered blessings, hoping that even though their bodies had been dismantled, their souls were intact and open to receiving our gratitude.



Before diagnosing people with depression, make sure they’re not surrounded by assholes.


[[Сочувствие не равно прощение|You can have compassion without forgiving]]. There are many ways to move on, and pretending to feel a certain way isn’t one of them.
…
We may want others’ forgiveness , but that comes from a place of self-gratification; we are asking forgiveness of others to avoid the harder work of forgiving ourselves.




Often people talk about suicide not because they want to be dead but because they want to end their pain.


… underneath [[the old mother-daughter frustration]] was not a wish for her to go away but a longing for her to stay forever

“I told Rita what I tell everyone who’s afraid of getting hurt in relationships—which is to say, everyone with a heartbeat. I explained to her that even in the best possible relationship, you’re going to get hurt sometimes, and no matter how much you love somebody, you will at times hurt that person, not because you want to, but because you’re human. You will inevitably hurt your partner, your parents, your children, your closest friend—and they will hurt you—because if you sign up for intimacy, getting hurt is part of the deal.

But, I went on, what was so great about a loving intimacy was that there was room for repair. Therapists call this process rupture and repair, and if you had parents who acknowledged their mistakes and took responsibility for them and taught you as a child to acknowledge your mistakes and learn from them too, then ruptures won’t feel so cataclysmic in your adult relationships. If, however, your childhood ruptures didn’t come with loving repairs, it will take some practice for you to tolerate the ruptures, to stop believing that every rupture signals the end, and to trust that even if a relationship doesn’t work out, you will survive that rupture too. You will heal and self-repair and sign up for another relationship full of its own ruptures and repairs. It’s not ideal, opening yourself up like this, putting your shield down, but if you want the rewards of an intimate relationship, there’s no way around it.”
