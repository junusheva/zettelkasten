### Invisible women - Caroline Perez

The study shows that countries with [[gender inflected languages]] as well as countries with [[genderless languages]] are very unequal. The most [[equal countries]] have a language that allows us to point out the gender but gender is not encoded into the words themselves.

If you cannot mark the gender nobody can see the problem.


##### Why should we prioritize snow clearing for pedastrians?
It all started as a joke. Some people thought that [[at least in snow-clearing there is no gender issues]]. Unfortunately feminist activists found one. In snow-clearing schedule car lanes were prioritized over pedestrian roads. As main care givers not only the majority of pedestrians were women but also they had complicated routes that involved picking up children from school, brining their parents to the doctor, buying groceries. However, men mostly had two points in their schedule: home and work. What is more pedestrians because of such schedule got so much injuries that it costed 4 million pounds to the economy.

The men didn’t deliberately put women in this position. As most of the people in charge were men they just were thinking what is comfortable for them, they were thinking about problems that are mostly familiar to them.

A five-year study in Skåne County ... found that [[the injuries cost money in healthcare and lost productivity]]. The estimated cost of all these pedestrian falls during just a single winter season was 36 million Kronor (around £3.2 million).
But even with this conservative estimate, the cost of pedestrian accidents in icy conditions was about twice the cost of winter road maintenance. 

Not only the instructions for snow clearing are gender biased. [[The infrastructure of the cities]] are built to satisfy only men’s needs too.


##### [[Gender-neutral playgrounds]]
In the mid-1990s, research by local officials in Vienna found that **from the age of ten, girls’ presence in parks and public playgrounds ‘decreases significantly’**. But rather than simply shrugging their shoulders and deciding that the girls just needed to toughen up, city officials wondered if there was something wrong with [[the design of parks]]. And so they planned some pilot projects, and they started to collect data.
What they found was revealing. It turned out that single large open spaces were the problem, because these forced girls to compete with the boys for space. And girls didn’t have the confidence to compete with the boys (that’s social conditioning for you) so they tended to just let the boys have the space. But when they subdivided the parks into smaller areas, the female drop-off was reversed. 


##### [[Parental leave]]
When Google noticed that they were losing women who had just given birth at twice the rate of other employees, they increased their meternity leave from three months at partial pay to five months at full pay. The attrition rate dropped 50%. ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/technology/in-googles-inner-circle-a-falling-number-of-women.html))

In the UK, 90% of single parents are women. In the US the figure is over 80%.

EU countries in general have 20 weeks of maternity leave. However the amount of weeks and the pay that women receive during their leave differs a lot across those countries. For example in Croatia women receive 7 months of maternity leave with a full pay, while in Britain women receive 9 months with 30% from their wage.



##### [[The Myth of Meritocracy]]
For most of the 20th century there were [[no female musicians]] in the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. There were a couple of blips in the 1950s and 60s, when a woman or two was hired, but those aside, the proportion of women sat stubbornly at zero. But then all of a sudden, something changed: from the 1970s onwards, the numbers of female players started to go up. And up.
Turnover in orchestras is extremely low. The composition of an orchestra is fairly static (at around one hundred players), and when you’re hired, it’s often for life; it’s rare that a musician is fired. So there was something remarkable going on when the proportion of women in this orchestra grew from a statistical 0% to 10% in a decade.
That something was [[blind auditions]]. Instituted in the early 1970s following a lawsuit, blind auditions are what they sound like: the hiring committee can’t see who is playing in the audition, because there is a screen between them and the player.2 The screens had an immediate impact. By the early 1980s, women began to make up 50% of the share of new hires. Today? the proportion of female musicians in the NEW York Philharmonic stands at over 45%.>

[[We teach brilliance bias to children from an early age]]. A recent US study found that when girls start primary school at the age of 5, they are as likely as five-year-old boys to think women could be ‘really really smart’. But by the time they turn six, something changes. They start doubting their gender. So much so, in fact, that they start limiting themselves: if a game is presented to them as intended for ‘children who are really, really smart’, five-year-old girls are as likely to want to play it as boys – but six-year-old girls are suddenly uninterested. Schools are teaching little girls that brilliance doesn’t belong to them.


##### [[Gender biased technology]]
Google’s speech-recognition software was 70% more likely to accurately recognise male speech than female speech – and it’s currently the best on the market ([source: 2017](https://makingnoiseandhearingthings.com/2016/07/12/googles-speech-recognition-has-a-gender-bias/)).

Apple launched its health monitoring system with all various cool features, but without a period tracker ([source: 2014](https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6844021/apple-promised-an-expansive-health-app-so-why-cant-i-track)).

Siri was biased with its searches too. You could quickly find Viagra or get an instruction in case of a heart attack, but not with an abortion or rape.

US started using female crash-test dummies only in 2011. Women being 47% more likely to be seriously injured in a car crash is one hell of an inequality to be overlooking



##### Business and investment
Male business owners get better and more often investments then female.

And it’s not always easy to convince someone a need exists if they don’t have that need themselves.

The presence of [[diverse perspectives]] makes businesses better informed about their customers


##### [[Gender bias in medicine]]
Research from the UK has found that women are 50% more likely to be **misdiagnosed following a heart attack** (rising to almost 60% for some types of heart attack).
A commonly known symptom of a heart attack is chest pain. However [[women heart attack symptoms]] actually are: stomach pain, breathlessness, nausea and fatigue.

The sputum test is also problematic for social reasons: a study in Pakistan reported that women felt uncomfortable coughing up the mucus needed for the examination, and health workers weren’t explaining why they needed to. So they didn’t.

(Girls with autism behave and look differently rather than boys). There is also emerging evidence that some girls with anorexia may in fact be suffering from autism, but because it’s not a typical male symptom it’s been missed.


##### [[Gender biased policies]]
When government cuts its spending on public services women have quit their work and do this job for free, while make unemployments stays almost the same.

Until 1977, child benefit in Britain was mainly credited to the father in the form of a tax reduction on his salary. After 1977 this tax deduction was replaced by a cash payment to the mother.

Japan has a similarly male-biased married-couples tax break. Since 1961, the ‘head of household’ (normally a man) has been able to ‘claim a tax deduction of ¥380,000 ($3,700) as long as his spouse’s income does not exceed ¥1.03m (around $10,000)’. A 2011 survey by Japan’s labour ministry found that ‘more than a third of married women who worked part time and deliberately curtailed their hours did so to keep the tax deduction’.
