### The happiness trap - Russ Harris
Created on: 2022-06-19 11:42

[[ACT]] proposes that the normal thinking processes of a healthy human mind will naturally lead to psychological suffering. You’re not defective—your mind’s just doing its job; the thing it evolved to do. Fortunately, ACT can teach you how to adapt to this in such a way that your life will be powerfully transformed.

In [[ACT]], whether a thought is true is not that important. Far more important is whether it’s helpful. Truthful or not, thoughts are nothing more than words. If they’re helpful words, then it’s worth paying attention to them. If they’re not helpful, then why bother?

There are [[two types of happiness]]: the feeling of happiness and when your life becomes meaningful, full, rich. The first one is a fleeting feeling, while the second is different.
